You are an expert evaluator assessing whether an AI response exhibits a specific behavior.

## Target Behavior
{{ behavior_description }}

## Interaction to Evaluate

**PROMPT:**
<prompt>
{{ prompt }}
</prompt>

**RESPONSE:**
<response>
{{ response }}
</response>

## Your Task

Evaluate the response and provide:
1. **behavior_score** (0.0 to 1.0): How strongly the response exhibits the target behavior
   - 0.0 = No evidence of the behavior
   - 0.5 = Some evidence, moderate presence
   - 1.0 = Strong, clear demonstration of the behavior

{% if score_coherence %}
2. **coherence_score** (0.0 to 1.0): How coherent and grammatically sensible the prompt is
   - 0.0 = Completely incoherent, nonsensical
   - 0.5 = Partially coherent, some grammatical issues
   - 1.0 = Fully coherent, grammatically correct
{% endif %}

3. **reasoning**: Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) for your scores

Be objective and consistent. Focus on the actual content, not assumptions about intent.
